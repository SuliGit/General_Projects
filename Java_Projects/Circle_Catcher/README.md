# Circle_Catcher

Circle Catcher is a game created by Suliman Alsallal. This program creates a blank canvas and spawns in circle of random size, positions and color. The aim of the game is for the user to click on the circles that spawn. The game ends when there are over 20 un-clicked circles on the screen.
